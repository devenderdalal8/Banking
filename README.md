# Application Architecture - MVVM Clean Architecture

The application architecture will follow the MVVM Clean Architecture (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to separate the UI and code structure logic from the data and business logic. This pattern allows for better maintainability, testability, and scalability of the application.

Components:
- Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. 
- View: Displays the UI and handles user interactions.
- ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, exposing data and operations to the View.

Android Jetpack Components:
- LiveData: Used to observe and update data in a lifecycle-aware manner, ensuring UI consistency and preventing memory leaks.
- Coroutines: Used for asynchronous programming and handling long-running tasks without blocking the main UI thread.
- ViewModel: Used to store and manage UI-related data across configuration changes, such as screen rotations.
- AppCompat: The AppCompat library adds support for showing an Action Bar within your Android App. It also adds support for Material Design for Android.
- Android KTX :Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions for Jetpack APIs and other Android APIs that will assist you in writing more concise and natural Kotlin code for your Android app

Other Component:
- KeyStore: The Android Keystore system lets you store cryptographic keys in a container to make them more difficult to extract from the device.
- Dagger hilt : Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application. 
- Retrofit: Retrofit is type-safe REST client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services.

# Login with Biometric Authentication

The application will implement a secure login mechanism using biometric authentication, specifically face or fingerprint recognition. The device's biometric authentication API will be utilized to authenticate users seamlessly.

Implementation Steps:
1. Check if the device supports biometric authentication.
2. Request biometric authentication from the user using the appropriate biometric prompt (fingerprint or face).
3. Capture and store the user's biometric data securely in the device's KeyStore or encrypt and store it securely because Keychain is not available on Android.
4. Implement logic to authenticate the user using biometric data during login.

# Localization and Arabic Support

The application will support localization and provide Arabic language translations. The user interface elements, including text, labels, and messages, will be localized to support both Arabic and English languages. Arabic language support will include RTL (Right-to-Left) layout.

Implementation Steps:
1. Provide localized string resources for both Arabic and English languages.
2. Implement a language selection feature that allows the user to switch between Arabic and English.
3. Apply the appropriate language and RTL layout direction based on the selected language.

# User Preferences

The application will include user preferences and settings to allow customization of the application's behavior. It will include options for selecting the default language.

Implementation Steps:
1. Create a settings screen where the user can configure preferences.
2. Include an option for selecting the default language (Arabic or English).
3. Store the selected preferences using Android KeyStore SharedPreferences.
4. Update the application's behavior and UI based on the selected preferences.

# Testing and Validation and Error Handling

Thorough testing will be conducted to ensure the functionality, reliability, and adherence to requirements of the application. The following areas will be tested:

1. Login: Test different scenarios such as valid and invalid credentials, successful and failed login attempts, and handling of error conditions.
2. Register: Test the registration process, including validation of input fields and handling of error conditions.
3. Error Handling: Test the application's ability to handle and display appropriate error messages in various scenarios, such as network errors, server errors, or invalid user input.
